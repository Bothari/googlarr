# Googlarr

> A chaotic and deeply unnecessary tool that applies googly eyes to your Plex posters on a schedule.  
> You were warned.

## WARNING â€” THIS PROJECT MAY RUIN YOUR POSTERS

Googlarr uses the Plex API to modify the posters for your Plex media items **in place**. It tries to save and restore the originals, but:

- It might miss a poster
- It might fail to restore properly
- Plex might cache something weird
- You might regret everything

**Use at your own risk. This project is for prank purposes only. I cannot provide support in case of failure.**

---

## What It Does

Googlarr is a scheduled prank daemon that:

1. Scans your Plex libraries for movies and/or shows
2. Detects faces and eye positions in poster images
3. Applies googly eyes using image overlays
4. Swaps the posters on a cron-based schedule
5. Restores the originals after the prank window

---

## Setup

1. Install via Docker Compose (see included `docker-compose.yml`)
2. Configure your `config.yml`
3. `docker compose up -d`
4. Pray
