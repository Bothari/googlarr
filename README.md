# Googlarr

> A chaotic and deeply unnecessary tool that applies googly eyes to your Plex posters on a schedule.

## WARNING â€” THIS PROJECT MAY RUIN YOUR POSTERS

Googlarr uses the Plex API to modify the posters for your Plex media items **in place**. It tries to save and restore the originals, but:

- It might miss a poster
- It might fail to restore properly
- Plex might cache something weird
- You might regret everything

**Use at your own risk. This project is for prank purposes only. I cannot provide support in case of failure.**

I highly recommend testing this on a dummy library in Plex before rolling it out for real. Create a new minimal library with just a handful of media items, and set that up in the config. Set up a very brief cron window to test it (e.g. starting at 10am today, and ending at 10.15am), to ensure that paths etc. are set up properly and poster restore works properly at the end of the time.

## What It Does

Googlarr is a scheduled prank daemon that:

1. Scans your Plex libraries for movies and/or shows
2. Detects faces and eye positions in poster images
3. Applies googly eyes using image overlays
4. Swaps the posters on a cron-based schedule
5. Restores the originals after the prank window

## Setup details

The script works by kicking off a number of workers. First it will sync poster info to a small database, and then download all the relevant posters. It took my low powered server about 30 minutes to process about 5000 items, with a poster success rate of about 75%. (Some posters don't have any faces, some detection just fails).

Based on the cron schedule in the config file, it will "sleep" a worker to start at that schedule time, at which point it will wake up and switch out all your posters.

To that end, I recommend setting the "start" schedule time to an hour or two in the future, then starting the container. That will give it time to process all the posters before switching them out.
